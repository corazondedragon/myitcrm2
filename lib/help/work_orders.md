### Work Orders

This page allows you to request service from Integrated Innovations by creating a Work Order. When you create a Work Order, a record is created on the web site and a notification is sent to the managers of Integrated Innovations. 

Once the Work Order is created, Integrated Innovations will assign a technician to it.

When the Work Order is modified, there is a notification that is also sent out to the assigned technician. This way he can be kept abreast of any changes in the priority or any technical data that may be needed for the service call.
